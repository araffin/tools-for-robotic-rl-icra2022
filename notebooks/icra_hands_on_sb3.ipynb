        "- (Optional) `render(method='human')` which allow to visualize the agent in action. Note that graphical interface does not work on google colab, so we cannot use it directly (we have to rely on `method='rbg_array'` to retrieve an image of the scene\n",

        "Under the hood, it also contains two useful properties:\n",
        "- `observation_space` which one of the gym spaces (`Discrete`, `Box`, ...) and describe the type and shape of the observation\n",
